    <p><i>The Indonesian technology company with the largest marketplace platform uses Epsilon’s private network to securely host its production IT infrastructure in a multi-cloud environment.</i><br><br>
      Epsilon, a global connectivity provider, has been selected by Tokopedia, an Indonesian technology company with a leading marketplace platform, to provide a secure and high-performance multi-cloud environment in Singapore. Epsilon’s managed cloud routing service connects Tokopedia’s production environments in Amazon Web Services (AWS), Google Cloud Platform and Alibaba Cloud via multiple high-speed Cloud Connects, serving the technology unicorn’s cloud to cloud needs via Epsilon’s private network.<br><br>

Epsilon delivers high-bandwidth cloud connections between Tokopedia’s IT infrastructure via its private network. Cloud Connect provides a scalable and flexible solution for Tokopedia to grow its bandwidth according to rising e-commerce demands in Indonesia, and delivers a secure marketplace platform for its 10+ million merchants and 100+ million monthly active users. Through Epsilon’s network fabric, Tokopedia is able to connect and manage its production IT infrastructure in a multi-cloud environment with improved availability and quality of experience.<br><br>

“We’re very excited to be working with Tokopedia to extend its cloud capabilities powering the leading online marketplace in Indonesia. Tokopedia now has the freedom to access and orchestrate the cloud services it needs as its business grows,” said Warren Aw, Managing Director, Asia Pacific at Epsilon. “We are solving the fundamental challenges of cloud connectivity that are often associated with management, performance and security. By utilising direct connections to multiple clouds, Tokopedia’s mission-critical applications and data in the cloud are secured. It can focus on improving its offering without having to worry about the network infrastructure.”<br><br>

Tokopedia can quickly provision new cloud interconnect services with automation through Epsilon’s Network as a Service (NaaS) platform Infiny. The platform allows users to buy and manage ethernet services for interconnecting data centres and direct connections to leading cloud service providers and internet exchanges globally.<br><br>

“Our platform helps merchants reach new audiences while providing a seamless online shopping experience for consumers. With the rising demands for a better digital experience, we needed an agile and flexible solution for securing and improving the performance of our connectivity to the cloud,” said Ryan de Melo, VP of Engineering at Tokopedia. “Epsilon’s cloud connectivity solutions make it simple for us to directly access the CSPs of our choice with the layer 3 routing that matches our needs. We look forward to Epsilon’s ongoing support in enabling us to build our reliable online marketplace for businesses and consumers across Indonesia, and to further achieve our mission of democratising commerce through technology.<br><br>

    <h2>Judge digs into Apple app store policies as Epic trial ends</h2>
      <h4 style="color:#aaa;">Published on Tuesday, 25 May 2021</h4>
      <h4> By <cite><a href="https://www.insidetelecom.com/author/associated-press/"> Associated Press</a></cite>. </h4>
      <img src="blog1\apple.jpg"  width="100% " height="500">
      <p>The judge who will decide a case challenging Apple’s stranglehold on its iPhone app store indicated on Monday she would like to promote more competition but without dismantling a commission system that reaps billions of dollars for the technology powerhouse.<br><br>
        U.S. District Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers isn’t likely to issue a decision until this summer. But she opened a window into her thoughts during a three-hour session with lawyers for Apple and its adversary, Epic Games, during the final day of a three-week trial in Oakland, California.<br><br>

Gonzalez Rogers’ line of questioning suggested she sides with much of the defense that Apple has mounted to justify the 15% to 30% commissions it collects for in-app transactions on the iPhone to help pay for the technology powering its devices.<br><br>

Epic Games, the maker of the popular videogame Fortnite, has been trying to prove the fees are the price-gouging tool of a monopoly hatched within the “walled garden” Apple has built around the iPhone, the app store, its software and other devices such as the iPad and iPod.<br><br>

To loosen Apple’s tight-fisted control, Epic wants Gonzalez Rogers to issue an order that would require Apple to open the iPhone and its other mobile products to rival app stores. Those alternatives would include Epic’s still-unprofitable app store, which charges a commission of just 12%.<br><br>

Apple’s app store, in contrast, has become far more profitable than its late co-founder, Steve Jobs, ever envisioned when he opened it 13 years ago. Precisely how profitable wasn’t revealed in the trial, although an Apple executive conceded the company had brought in at least $20 billion as of June 2017.<br><br>

Gonzalez Rogers doesn’t seem to believe the fees are unreasonable, let alone illegal. That’s in part because because Apple’s commissions mirror those charged on in-app commissions by the app store feeding about 3 billion devices powered by Google’s Android software, as well as those imposed by major video game consoles — Sony’s PlayStation, Microsoft ‘s Xbox and Nintendo’s Switch.<br><br>

The judge also seemed to support Apple’s right to maintain a rigidly controlled ecosystem of products that has won over consumers around the world, including many who pay more than $1,000 to buy an iPhone.<br><br>

“Your formulation seems to ignore the reality that customers choose an ecosystem,” Gonzalez Rogers told Epic lawyer Gary Bornstein. “It is Apple’s business strategy to create a particular type of ecosystem that is incredibly attractive to purchasers, to its consumers. So if those consumers choose to enter into an ecosystem … that’s what you know you’re buying into.”<br><br>

Bornstein countered that most consumers don’t understand the extent they will be locked into Apple’s ecosystem and often pay scant attention to the costs of in-app purchases that are tiny compared to the price of an iPhone.<br><br>

That still didn’t seem to convince Gonzalez Rogers that Apple is running on monopoly, but other statements made it clear she still might find the company is engaging in anticompetitive behavior. During some points in the trial, she has seemed trouble by a provision in Apple stores that forbids in-app notices that purchases can also be made through web browsers and other means that evade Apple’s commissions.<br><br>

Apple contends allowing in-app links to other payment options besides its own would expose iPhones and other mobile devices to security and privacy threats. When facing some tough questioning from Gonzalez Rogers during his four-hour appearance on the witness stand Friday, Apple CEO Tim Cook also conceded that allowing links within apps to other payment options would undercut the company’s profits.<br><br>

The judge revisited the issue during Monday’s session. At one point, she wondered aloud whether Apple could just allow apps to insert a notice reminding consumers that payments can made in web browsers, without posting a direct link to the checkout stand. That sort of notice, she mused, wouldn’t be much different than a merchant’s display of the different credit cards — Visa, Mastercard, America Express or Discover — that has long been a staple at cash registers.<br><br>

During the course of their closing arguments, the lawyers for Epic and Apple each made dramatic pitches in an attempt to get Gonzalez Rogers to see things their respective ways.<br><br>

Bornstein repeatedly asserted that Apple is trying to paint itself as a “benevolent overlord” acting in the best interests of consumers and the developers of the 1.8 million apps now in the store, up from just 500 in 2008. “But it’s not enough to say, ‘We’re a great company, we’re doing well, and we’re a nice guy,'” Bornstein argued.<br><br>

Apple lawyer Richard Doren reminded the judge that opening the iPhone to other app stores would weaken a security system that protects consumers and developers alike. Epic “wants Apple to drop its gloves, stand in the middle of the arena and take malware attacks through unreviewed apps,” Doren argued.<br><br>

Gonzalez Rogers said last week that she hoped to issue her decision by Aug. 13. But on Monday warned she may need even more time to review thousands of pages of information submitted during the case.</p>
